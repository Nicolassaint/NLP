    "2. Adapt this dataset for a *local* semantic search task and propose an appropriate evaluation metric:\n",
    "    - Implement a simple baseline based on **TF-IDF**.\n",
    "    - Use a pre-trained transformer-based model, and fine-tune it.\n",
    "3. Test these approaches on the [CommonSense QA](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1421/) dataset. \n",
    "4. Adapt these approaches for a *global* semantic search task on the [WikiQA](https://aclanthology.org/D15-1237/) dataset for open domain question answering.\n",
    "5. **Bonus** (Optional) Apply a model (any, as long as it's running) to the original Squad QA task."

    "**Conclusion :** As planned, RoBERTa is more accurate than DistilBERT for the 500 samples we took. However, it is also much longer to process the samples with almost twice more time to process. The balance between accuracy and computational ressources is thus a very important parameter to take into account in the NLP field. SOTA models are not always suited of every task as they are often more complex and longer to run."
