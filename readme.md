# Natural Language Processing (2023-2024)

This repository contains course materials and four lab projects for the "Natural Language Processing" - DS-télécom-20 course followed at Télécom Paris for the Master 2 Data Science during the academic year 2023-2024.

## Course Description

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a very important field of research, which we can find applications of everywhere. During the last decade, deep Learning has profoundly transformed the way we do NLP, bringing huge performance gains in many traditional tasks involving natural language thanks to end-to-end neural models - relying mainly on the availability of textual data. The goal of this course is to provide students with (1) a theoretical understanding of modern NLP models
through a review of the most important milestones in recent NLP (2) a practical understanding of the difficulties of performing machine learning tasks on natural language, and how to apply NLP techniques
in novel circumstances.

## Labs

The repository includes four lab projects and course labs, each lab project is focusing on different key aspects of NLP:

1. **Lab 1: Character n-gram Language Models and applications**

2. **Lab 2: RNN - Topic modeling and classification**

3. **Lab 3: CNN - Word sense disambiguation**

4. **Lab 4: CNN - Sentiment Analysis with modern NLP tools**
